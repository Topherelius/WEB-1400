# WEB-1400
HTML/CSS Beginner projects
Just creating a couple of files to work through my beginner projects in front end development.  I will add other repositories for C++, Scripting, and Data Algorithm coding in c++.  I will probably also put some back-end stuff as I work through the WEB-3400 class.
I am a student at Weber State University and I am majoring in Network Management Technology with a minor in Computer Science.
